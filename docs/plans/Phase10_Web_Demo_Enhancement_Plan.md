# Phase 10: Web Demo Enhancement Plan

<!--
IMPORTANT: THIS IS JUST A DEMO!
- The goal is to get users familiar with LLM security and guardrail concepts.
- It is also for our own team to ensure the underlying core library works for real-world use-cases.
- That's it. Simple, stable, clear, clean. No unnecessary complexity or features.
-->

## Overview

Transform the web demo from a basic proof-of-concept into a comprehensive showcase of Stinger's capabilities. This phase will address frontend stability issues, improve UI/UX, enhance logging visualization, and expand guardrail demonstrations while maintaining strict performance criteria.

## Objectives

1. **Frontend Stability**: Fix memory issues and ensure reliable production deployment
2. **Performance Optimization**: Meet strict build and runtime performance targets
3. **UI/UX Overhaul**: Create unified, modern interface for guardrails and logging
4. **Enhanced Capabilities**: Showcase all 14+ guardrail types with comprehensive features
5. **Production Readiness**: Ensure maintainable, simple design (not full accessibility or mobile compliance)

## Engineering Guidance (Read First)

- **Investigate First:**
  - Before proposing fixes, thoroughly investigate and document the current frontend memory and stability issues. Do not assume root cause (e.g., webpack, Node, or code issues). Use profiling and logs to establish a baseline.
  - Document findings and only then propose targeted solutions (e.g., --max-old-space-size, Vite, etc.).

- **No Mobile Support:**
  - This demo is desktop-only. Do not implement or test for mobile responsiveness.

- **No Accessibility Requirements:**
  - Only basic web best practices and tooltips are required. No ARIA, 509/ADA, or advanced accessibility work.

- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Leverage and demo the existing Core HealthMonitor and metrics. Do not build new aggregation, storage, or charting complexity. Just surface what's already in Core.

- **Logging:**
  - Only show logs for the current conversation. No need for high-rate streaming, virtualization, or WebSockets. This is a single-user, low-rate demo. Simplicity is the goal.

- **Guardrail Configuration:**
  - Use a fixed list of guardrails. The only configuration in the UI is enable/disable toggles for each guardrail. No dynamic schema editing, no parameter adjustment, no config UI generation.

- **Dependencies:**
  - Minimize new dependencies. Only add a new library if it provides a clear, major benefit.

- **Panel State Management:**
  - Only one panel should ever be open at a time. There is no need for multi-panel management, stacking, or z-index complexity. Opening a new panel should always close any currently open panel.
  - Use React local state or Context API for panel state. Avoid Redux unless absolutely necessary.

- **Other Suggestions:**
  - Error boundaries are encouraged to prevent full app crashes.
  - If adding performance budget checks, use simple tools (e.g., webpack-bundle-analyzer) only if they provide clear value.
  - Feature flags and Storybook are optional; only add if they help you move faster.

## Performance Criteria (MUST MEET)

### Build & Launch Speed
- **Build Time**: < 30 seconds for production build
- **Startup Time**: < 10 seconds from command to usable interface
- **Bundle Size**: < 2MB total frontend bundle (gzipped, initial load)
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB RAM for frontend dev server
- **Dependencies**: < 50 npm packages total

### Runtime Performance
- **Page Load**: < 2 seconds initial page load
- **API Response**: < 500ms for all endpoints
- **Real-time Updates**: < 100ms for log updates (if applicable)
- **Guardrail Switching**: < 200ms for enable/disable operations

## Current State Analysis

### Backend Status ✅
- **API Endpoints**: All responding correctly (200 OK)
- **Guardrails**: 4 total, 3 enabled, processing requests
- **OpenAI Integration**: Real LLM responses working
- **Audit Logging**: Active and recording events
- **CORS**: Configured for frontend communication
- **Error Handling**: Proper 404/422 responses
- **Load Testing**: Handles 5+ concurrent requests
- **Stability**: Runs continuously without crashes

### Frontend Status ❌
- **Dev Server Memory Issues**: "The build failed because the process exited too early"
- **Resource Management**: "This probably means the system ran out of memory"
- **Process Instability**: Frontend processes being killed
- **Inconsistent Startup**: Sometimes works, often crashes
- **Limited Guardrails**: Only 4 guardrails available vs 14+ total

## Phase 10A: Core Infrastructure & Stability (Priority 1)

### 10A.1 Frontend Stability Fixes
**Objective**: Investigate and resolve memory issues; ensure reliable deployment

**Implementation**:
- **Investigation:**
  - Profile and document the current frontend memory and stability characteristics. Identify root causes before implementing fixes.
- **Memory Optimization:**
  - Based on findings, apply targeted fixes (e.g., Node.js memory flags, Vite migration, webpack config changes).
  - Add memory monitoring if needed for debugging.
- **Production Build:**
  - Ensure reliable production deployment (test static file serving, validate build output).
- **Docker Containerization:**
  - Containerize frontend for resource management if needed.
- **Alternative Serving:**
  - Use nginx or similar for static file serving if it helps stability.

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Frontend runs stably without memory crashes
- ✅ Production build serves reliably
- ✅ Memory usage stays under 512MB
- ✅ Startup time under 10 seconds

### 10A.2 Backend Enhancement
**Objective**: Expand guardrail support and improve performance

**Implementation**:
- **Guardrail Expansion:**
  - Add all 14+ available guardrail types to demo (fixed list, no dynamic config)
  - Local guardrails: keyword_block, keyword_list, regex_filter, length_filter, url_filter, topic_filter
  - AI guardrails: content_moderation, prompt_injection, ai_pii_detection, ai_toxicity_detection, ai_code_generation
  - Simple guardrails: simple_pii_detection, simple_toxicity_detection, simple_code_generation
- **Configuration Management:**
  - UI: Only enable/disable toggles for each guardrail. No parameter editing or schema config.
- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Surface and demo the existing Core HealthMonitor metrics. No new aggregation, storage, or charting.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Improve error messages and debugging information as needed.

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All 14+ guardrail types available and functional

  - Panels overlay the main chat area, close on "X" or click-away
  - Panel triggers in the header
  - **Only one panel open at a time; opening a new panel closes any currently open panel.**
  - Each panel is focused (guardrails, logs, help, etc.)
  - Main chat area remains uncluttered
- **Consistent Styling:**
  - Unified design system (colors, spacing, typography)
  - Consistent animations and transitions
- **Modern Design System:**
  - Use modern CSS (Grid, Flexbox)
  - Add tooltips where appropriate

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Unified visual design across all panels

- ✅ Modern, professional appearance

### 10B.2 Enhanced Logging Interface
**Objective**: Show conversation-focused, visually dense logging (current conversation only)

**Implementation**:
- **Conversation-Focused View:**
  - Show only logs for the current conversation
  - No need for high-rate streaming, virtualization, or WebSockets
- **Visual Density:**
  - Compact, scannable log entries with icons and color coding
- **Filtering Options:**
  - Simple filter by log type if needed

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Conversation log is clear and easy to scan
- ✅ No performance issues at single-user, low-rate usage

### 10B.3 Improved Guardrail Panel
**Objective**: Simple, intuitive guardrail enable/disable interface

**Implementation**:
- **Visual Toggles:**
  - Checkbox/switch for each guardrail (enable/disable only)
  - Status indicators (enabled, disabled, error)
  - Visual feedback for state changes
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Show real-time metrics from Core HealthMonitor (no new charts or storage)
- **Category Grouping:**
  - Group guardrails by type (AI vs Local, Input vs Output)

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Enable/disable toggles work for each guardrail
- ✅ Performance metrics visible (from Core)
- ✅ Logical grouping and organization

## Phase 10C: Enhanced Capabilities (Priority 3)
