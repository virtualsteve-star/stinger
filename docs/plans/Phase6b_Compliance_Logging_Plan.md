## Overview

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Start Date**: June 28, 2024  
**Completion Date**: June 29, 2024  
**Current Status**: Complete  
**Dependencies**: Phase 6a (Documentation Review) ✅ COMPLETE

## Goal
Design and implement a security audit trail system for Stinger that records all security-relevant behavior (prompts, responses, guardrail decisions, conversation flows) to support forensic analysis, incident investigation, and regulatory compliance.

**Note: This is NOT developer debug logging - this is behavior tracking for security audit purposes.**

## Motivation
- **Security forensics**: Reconstruct exactly what happened during security incidents
- **Compliance audit**: Provide complete audit trail of all LLM security decisions
- **Incident investigation**: Track conversation flows and guardrail enforcement
- **Regulatory requirements**: Meet enterprise audit and compliance mandates
- **Non-repudiation**: Prove what prompts were processed and what responses were given

## Requirements

### Security Audit Requirements
- **Complete behavior tracking**: Record ALL user prompts, LLM responses, and guardrail decisions
- **No gaps in audit trail**: Cannot be disabled in production, no sampling of security events
- **Forensic reconstruction**: Log enough context to completely reconstruct security incidents
- **User attribution**: Track user identity, session, IP address, timestamp for all events
- **Conversation flow tracking**: Maintain complete conversation state and turn sequence

### Developer Experience Requirements  
- **Ultra-simple enable**: Zero-config startup with `audit.enable()`
- **Easy log destination**: Simple path or "stdout" configuration
- **Smart environment detection**: Auto-configures for dev vs production
- **Progressive disclosure**: Simple by default, powerful when needed
- **Separate from debug logs**: Distinct from developer troubleshooting logs
- **Easy viewing**: Tools to query and view audit trail during development

### System Requirements
- **High performance**: Async buffering with background writer thread - zero impact on LLM processing
- **Enterprise scale**: Handle 1000+ requests/second with batched I/O operations
- **Reliability**: Configurable failure handling (fail-safe vs continue)
- **Structured format**: JSON format optimized for audit trail queries
- **PII protection**: Configurable redaction while preserving audit value
- **Storage management**: Log rotation and retention policies

## Deliverables
- Security audit trail system (separate from debug logging)
- Ultra-simple audit enable API: `audit.enable()` with smart defaults
- Easy destination configuration: `audit.enable("./logs/audit.log")` or `audit.enable("stdout")`
- Smart environment detection for automatic configuration
- Structured audit log format optimized for forensic analysis
- Async buffering system with background writer thread for zero-impact performance
- Developer-friendly audit trail viewing and query tools
- Complete conversation flow reconstruction capability
- Simple audit log export utility for compliance reporting (CSV and JSON formats)
- Getting started example in `/examples/getting_started/` showing zero-config setup
- Clear documentation separating audit logs from debug logs
- Example: Complete audit trail of multi-turn conversation with security decisions
- Comprehensive test suite (see Phase6b_Security_Audit_Trail_Test_Plan.md)

## Ultra-Simple Audit Trail API

### Zero-Config Startup
```python
# Just enable it - smart defaults handle everything!
from stinger import audit
audit.enable()
```

### Easy Log Destination Config
```python
# Common cases - just pass the destination
audit.enable("./logs/security.log")  # File logging
audit.enable("stdout")               # Console logging (dev)

# With minimal options
audit.enable("./logs/audit.log", redact_pii=True)
```

### Smart Environment Detection
```python
# Auto-detects environment and chooses smart defaults:
# - Development: stdout (see logs immediately)
# - Production: ./audit.log (persistent storage) 
# - Docker: stdout (container logging)
audit.enable()  # Just works!
```

### Progressive Configuration
```python
# Advanced cases (only when needed)
audit.enable(
    destination="./logs/audit.log",
    redact_pii=True,
    fail_safe=False,  # Continue processing if audit logging fails
    custom_redactor=my_redactor_func
)
```

### Development Tools
```python
# View audit trail during development
audit.query(conversation_id="conv_123")
audit.query(user_id="user_456", last_hour=True)
```

### Security Audit Record Format
```python
# Focused on security behavior tracking, not debug info
{
    # Core audit fields
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.123Z",  # High precision for forensics
    "event_type": "guardrail_decision",  # What security behavior occurred
    "request_id": "req_abc123",  # Single correlation ID for request
    
    # User attribution (critical for security audit)
    "user_id": "user_456",
    "session_id": "sess_789",
    "user_ip": "192.168.1.100",  # For forensics
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
    
    # Conversation tracking
    "conversation_id": "conv_123",
    "turn_number": 5,
    "conversation_state": "active",
    
    # Security behavior data
    "prompt": "User input text (redacted if PII)",
    "response": "LLM output text (redacted if PII)",
    "guardrail_decisions": [
        {
            "filter_name": "content_moderation",
            "decision": "block",  # block, allow, warn
            "reason": "Content violates policy",
            "confidence": 0.95,
            "rule_triggered": "violence_detection"
        }
    ],
    
    # Processing context (for reconstruction)
    "processing_time_ms": 45,
    "model_used": "gpt-4.1-nano",
    "tokens_processed": 150
}
```

## Configuration Examples

### 90% Use Cases - Ultra Simple
```python
# Zero config - just works
audit.enable()

# File logging
audit.enable("./logs/audit.log")

# Console logging (development)
audit.enable("stdout")

# With PII redaction
audit.enable("./logs/audit.log", redact_pii=True)
```

### Advanced Cases (When Needed)
```python
# Multiple destinations
audit.enable(["./logs/audit.log", "stdout"])

# Custom configuration
audit.enable(
    destination="./logs/audit.log",
    redact_pii=True,
    fail_safe=False,
    custom_redactor=my_redactor_func
)
```

### Smart Defaults by Environment
```python
# Development: stdout, no PII redaction, continue on failure
# Production: ./audit.log, PII redaction, continue on failure
# Docker: stdout, PII redaction, continue on failure
audit.enable()  # Automatically chooses based on environment
```

### Environment Variables (12-factor app support)
```bash
STINGER_AUDIT_ENABLED=true
STINGER_AUDIT_DESTINATION=./logs/audit.log  # or "stdout"
STINGER_AUDIT_REDACT_PII=true
```

## High-Level Steps

5. **Add user attribution**: Track user identity, session, IP address for forensic analysis
6. **Implement conversation flow tracking**: Maintain complete conversation state and turn sequence
7. **Implement async buffering system**: Background writer thread with batched I/O for enterprise performance
8. **System reliability features**: Configurable failure handling (fail-safe vs continue)
9. **Audit viewing tools**: Create query and viewing utilities for development
10. **PII redaction**: Implement redaction while preserving audit trail value
11. **Audit export utility**: Create export tool for compliance and forensic analysis
12. **Testing and validation**: Execute comprehensive test plan focused on audit completeness
13. **Getting started example**: Create simple example in `/examples/getting_started/` showing zero-config audit setup
