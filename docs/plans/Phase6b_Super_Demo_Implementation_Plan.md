# Phase 6b Super Demo Implementation Plan

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ IN PROGRESS
**Start Date:** 2025-06-28
**Completion Date:** 2025-06-30

## Overview
This plan covers the implementation of the "Super Demo" for the Stinger Guardrails Framework, which demonstrates a modern web-based chat UI, a FastAPI backend, real LLM integration, and Stinger guardrails applied to both input and output. The demo is designed to be fully runnable locally and to showcase conversation-aware filtering, audit logging, and flexible guardrail configuration.

## Objectives
- Build a React-based chat frontend with a settings pane for guardrail toggling
- Implement a FastAPI backend integrating Stinger guardrails and OpenAI
- Demonstrate conversation-aware prompt injection filtering
- Provide real-time audit log viewing in the UI
- Ensure all code is isolated in `demos/web_demo/`
- Document setup and usage for local runs

## Key Deliverables
- Modern React chat UI (with settings, audit log, and guardrail toggling)
- FastAPI backend with Stinger and OpenAI integration
- End-to-end demo: user input â†’ input guardrails â†’ LLM â†’ output guardrails â†’ frontend
- Documentation in `demos/web_demo/README.md`

## Implementation Steps
1. **Frontend Implementation**
   - Build chat UI with React (functional components, hooks)
   - Add settings pane for guardrail toggling
   - Implement audit log viewer
   - Add prompt injection screening options (regular vs. conversation-aware)
   - Style for modern, responsive layout
2. **Backend Implementation**
   - Set up FastAPI server in `demos/web_demo/backend/`
   - Integrate Stinger guardrails and Conversation API
   - Add endpoints for chat, guardrails, audit log, and settings
   - Connect to OpenAI for LLM responses
3. **Integration & Testing**
   - Connect frontend to backend over HTTP/HTTPS
   - Test all guardrail toggling and audit log features
   - Validate conversation-aware filtering
   - Ensure all code is isolated from production
4. **Documentation**
   - Write setup and usage instructions
   - Document guardrail configuration and demo features

## Status & Progress
- Most core features are implemented and working end-to-end
- Some polish and additional testing/documentation remain
- The demo is not yet fully productionized or dockerized
- Some UI/UX improvements and edge case handling are still in progress

## Timeline
- **Start Date:** 2025-06-28 (file creation date)
- **Completion Date:** 2025-06-30 (today)

## Risks & Considerations
- Local SSL setup adds complexity; may be simplified in future
- Some features (e.g., multi-user, Docker) are out of scope for this phase
- Ongoing work may be needed to polish UI and documentation

## Exit Criteria
- All core demo features work as described
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Demo is runnable locally by new users
- Outstanding issues are tracked for future work
