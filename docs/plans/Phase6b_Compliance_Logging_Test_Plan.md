# Phase 6b Compliance Logging Test Plan

**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**  
**Start Date**: 2025-06-28  
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-28  

## Overview
Comprehensive testing of the compliance logging system to ensure correctness, performance, reliability, and security under various conditions and failure scenarios.

## Test Categories

### 1. Functional Tests

#### 1.1 Python Logging Integration
- **ComplianceHandler integration**: Test handler works with Python logging module
- **Log record compatibility**: Verify logs include standard Python LogRecord fields
- **Structured logging**: Test integration with structlog and python-json-logger
- **Log level filtering**: Test standard Python log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- **Logger hierarchy**: Test compliance logging respects Python logger hierarchy

#### 1.2 Guardrail Event Logging
- **Block events**: Test logging when guardrails block requests
- **Warning events**: Test logging when guardrails issue warnings but allow passage
- **Pass events**: Test logging when guardrails pass requests without issues
- **Multiple guardrail triggers**: Test scenarios where multiple guardrails fire simultaneously
- **Guardrail metadata**: Verify guardrail name, reason, confidence scores are logged

#### 1.3 Ultra-Simple API Testing
- **Zero-config enable**: Test `audit.enable()` works with no configuration
- **Easy destination config**: Test `audit.enable("./logs/audit.log")` and `audit.enable("stdout")`
- **Smart environment detection**: Test auto-configuration for dev vs production environments
- **Progressive configuration**: Test simple cases work, advanced cases available when needed
- **Environment variables**: Test environment variable configuration
- **Multiple destinations**: Test `audit.enable(["./logs/audit.log", "stdout"])`
- **Invalid configurations**: Test graceful handling of malformed config

### 2. Performance Tests

#### 2.1 Audit Throughput Testing
- **High volume audit logging**: Test with 1000+ concurrent requests (all logged)
- **Sustained audit load**: Run for extended periods with complete audit trail
- **No sampling allowed**: Test that ALL security events are captured under load
- **Memory usage**: Monitor memory consumption during complete audit logging
- **Pipeline impact**: Measure latency added to main processing pipeline

#### 2.2 Async Audit Performance
- **Buffer efficiency**: Test audit log buffering reduces I/O operations
- **Flush intervals**: Verify periodic flushing works correctly for audit logs
- **Complete capture**: Test no audit events are lost during high load
- **Backpressure handling**: Test when audit logging can't keep up with input rate
- **Fail-safe behavior**: Test system behavior when audit logging falls behind

### 3. Reliability Tests

#### 3.1 Failure Handling
- **Disk full scenarios**: Test behavior when log destination runs out of space
- **Permission errors**: Test handling of write permission failures
- **Corrupted log files**: Test recovery from corrupted log files
- **Process crashes**: Test log integrity after unexpected shutdowns

#### 3.2 Fail-safe vs Continue Behavior
- **Fail-safe mode**: Test that pipeline stops when logging fails critically
- **Continue mode**: Test that pipeline continues when logging fails non-critically
- **Configuration switching**: Test changing failure modes at runtime

### 4. System Integration Tests

#### 4.1 Pipeline Integration
- **End-to-end flows**: Test complete request flows with logging enabled
- **Filter integration**: Test logging with all types of filters (content, PII, toxicity, etc.)
- **Conversation management**: Test logging with conversation-aware features
- **Configuration reload**: Test logging continues correctly during config reloads

### 5. Security Tests

#### 5.1 Data Protection
- **Redaction effectiveness**: Verify PII is properly removed from logs
- **Access control**: Test log file permissions and access restrictions
- **Sensitive data handling**: Test credit cards, SSNs, emails are redacted
- **Configuration security**: Test that sensitive config values aren't logged

### 6. Basic Monitoring Tests

#### 6.1 Basic Health and Metrics
- **Health status**: Test basic logging system health reporting
- **Basic metrics**: Test collection of throughput, error rates, buffer status only
- **Recovery validation**: Test health recovery after failures

### 7. Export Utility Tests

#### 7.1 Simple Export Functions
- **Date range exports**: Test exporting logs for specific time periods
- **Basic filtering**: Test filtering by conversation ID, user ID, time range only
- **Format support**: Test JSON export format only (CSV if simple to implement)
- **Performance**: Test export performance with moderate dataset sizes (not enterprise scale)

### 8. Edge Cases and Error Conditions

#### 8.1 Resource Exhaustion
- **Memory limits**: Test behavior when system memory is constrained
- **Disk space**: Test graceful degradation as disk space decreases
- **File descriptor limits**: Test handling of OS file descriptor limits

#### 8.2 Data Scenarios
- **Large messages**: Test logging of large inputs/outputs (up to 1MB)
- **Unicode and special characters**: Test proper encoding of international text
- **Malformed JSON**: Test resilience to invalid JSON in log entries

## Test Data Requirements

### Synthetic Data Sets
- **Normal conversations**: Multi-turn conversations with various topics
- **Guardrail triggers**: Conversations designed to trigger each guardrail type
- **High-volume scenarios**: Thousands of concurrent conversations
- **Edge case inputs**: Large, malformed, or unusual inputs

### Performance Baselines
- **Latency targets**: <10ms additional latency for normal operations
- **Throughput targets**: Handle 1000+ requests/second without degradation
- **Memory targets**: <100MB additional memory usage under normal load
- **Sampling efficiency**: 10% sampling should reduce overhead by 80%+
- **Buffer efficiency**: Reduce disk I/O operations by 80%+ through buffering

## Test Environment Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Multiple environments**: Unit, integration, staging environments only
- **Basic monitoring**: Simple metrics collection for test validation
- **Load generation**: Basic tools to simulate moderate traffic volumes
- **Failure injection**: Simple failure scenario testing (disk full, permission errors)

### Test Automation
- **CI/CD integration**: All tests run automatically on code changes
- **Performance regression**: Automated detection of performance degradation
- **Test reporting**: Basic test result reporting
