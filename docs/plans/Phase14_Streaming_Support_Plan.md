# Phase 14: Comprehensive Streaming Support Implementation

## Overview
Phase 14 focuses on implementing end-to-end streaming support for Stinger, addressing the plugin team's critical performance issues with monitoring streaming LLM responses. This phase builds on the REST API foundation from Phase 13 to create a real-time, high-performance guardrail system.

## Objectives
1. **Reduce API calls for streaming content by 70%** (from 20 to 6 per message) - *Revised per QA feedback*
2. Enable real-time content checking without blocking user experience
3. Implement intelligent guardrail execution based on performance characteristics
4. Provide visibility into guardrail checking progress
5. Support both synchronous blocking and asynchronous monitoring modes
6. **Maintain robust error handling and security** - *Added per QA feedback*

```

### Performance Classes Integration - *Simplified per QA feedback*
**Three-Level Checkpoint Strategy:**
- **IMMEDIATE**: INSTANT + FAST guardrails (<100ms) → Check every chunk
- **BATCHED**: MODERATE guardrails (100-1000ms) → Check at sentence boundaries  
- **DEFERRED**: SLOW + VERY_SLOW guardrails (>1s) → Monitor mode, check at end only

**Security Rules:**
- Client-side execution: INSTANT regex/keyword rules only
- Server-side execution: All AI-based and external API rules

### Monitor Mode Decision Matrix
| Guardrail Type | Performance | Default Mode | Streaming | Can Override |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Regex PII | INSTANT | BLOCK | Every chunk | No |
| Keyword Block | FAST | BLOCK | Sentences | Yes |
| Local ML | MODERATE | BLOCK | Paragraphs | Yes |
| AI Analysis | SLOW | MONITOR | End only | Yes |
| External API | VERY_SLOW | MONITOR | End only | No |

## Success Metrics - *Revised per QA Feedback*

- **Streaming Latency**: < 200ms per chunk - *Accounts for network overhead*
- **API Call Reduction**: 70% (20 → 6 per message) - *More realistic target*
- **Audit Log Reduction**: 90% (session-based aggregation)
- **Monitor Mode Overhead**: < 15ms added latency - *More conservative*

### 🔄 **Partial Agreement - Architectural Decisions Maintained**
1. **Checkpoint Strategy Value** - While simplified, performance-based checkpointing remains core optimization
2. **Session Complexity** - Some complexity needed for production robustness, but simplified API surface

### ❌ **Respectful Disagreements**
1. **Implementation Timeline** - Original plan already prioritized performance characteristics in Week 1
2. **Over-Engineering Assessment** - The performance classification system is the key differentiator for Stinger

### 🎯 **Core Value Preserved**
The streaming architecture's core value proposition remains intact:
- Performance-based guardrail execution
- Monitor mode for expensive operations  
- Real-time content checking without blocking
- Intelligent optimization based on guardrail characteristics

**Conclusion**: QA feedback significantly improved the plan's production readiness while preserving the core architectural benefits.
