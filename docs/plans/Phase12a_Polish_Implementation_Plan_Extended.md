## Additional Critical Documentation Tasks

### Web Demo & Management Console Visibility

**Problem**: The most impressive demos (web demo and management console) are completely hidden from users in the main documentation.

**Tasks**:
1. **Add prominent web demo section to README.md**
   - Add dedicated section showcasing the interactive web interface
   - Include screenshot or animated GIF
   - Clear instructions on how to run it
   - Highlight real-time guardrail feedback feature

2. **Add management console section to README.md**
   - Showcase the monitoring dashboard
   - Include screenshot of the real-time metrics
   - Instructions for accessing the console
   - Highlight system monitoring capabilities

3. **Update demos/README.md**
   - Add web demo to the demo listing
   - Add management console to the demo listing
   - Provide clear descriptions of what each showcases

### AI Filter & API Key Documentation

**Problem**: No clear examples showing how to use AI-powered filters with OpenAI API keys.

**Tasks**:
1. **Create AI filter example** (`examples/getting_started/11_ai_powered_filters.py`)
   - Show simple regex filter vs AI-powered filter
   - Demonstrate API key requirement
   - Show graceful fallback when no API key
   - Use content_moderation preset as example

**Tasks**:
1. **Enhance audit trail visibility**
   - Move audit trail example earlier in getting started sequence
   - Add audit trail activation to the main README examples
   - Show how to access and read audit logs
   - Demonstrate PII redaction feature
