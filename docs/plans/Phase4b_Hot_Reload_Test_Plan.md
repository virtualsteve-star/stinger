# Phase 4b Hot Reload Test Plan

**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**  
**Start Date**: 2025-06-24  
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-24  

## Overview
This test plan ensures comprehensive validation of the Hot Reload feature, focusing on robust file system event handling, integration/system tests, developer experience, and CLI/UX polish. The goal is to guarantee that hot reload is reliable, user-friendly, and production-ready.

## Test Strategy

### Test Levels
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Core hot reload logic (reload, validation, rollback, status)
2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end file system event handling
   - Development workflow simulation
   - Error and rollback scenarios
3. **System/Manual Tests**
   - Real-world developer workflows
   - CLI/UX usability
4. **Documentation Validation**
   - Getting started, troubleshooting, and CLI usage

### Test Environments
- **Development**: Local dev setup (primary for file event tests)
- **CI/CD**: Automated pipeline (integration/system tests may be skipped if flaky)
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for manual validation

## 1. Automated File System Event Testing

### 1.1 Integration Tests
- **Test Suite:** `test_hot_reload_integration.py`
- **Scenarios:**
  - [ ] Modify config file on disk, verify reload callback is triggered
  - [ ] Multiple rapid changes, verify debounce and correct reload count
  - [ ] Delete config file, verify error handling and status
  - [ ] Permission errors (read-only file), verify error reporting
  - [ ] Invalid config written, verify rollback and error message
- **Techniques:**
  - Use `threading.Event` or similar to synchronize test and observer
  - Add debug output to confirm event flow
  - Mark as integration/system tests (may be skipped in CI)

### 1.2 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] File changes trigger reloads within 1 second
- [ ] Rollback occurs on invalid config
- [ ] Status reporting is accurate after reloads
- [ ] Tests reliably pass in local/dev environments

## 2. Integration Test Coverage

### 2.1 Development Workflow
- **Test:** Edit config file, verify reload without restart
- **Test:** Make multiple edits, verify all are applied in order

### 2.2 Error Handling
- **Test:** Write invalid config, verify validation prevents reload and triggers rollback
- **Test:** Restore valid config, verify reload resumes

### 2.3 Status Reporting
- **Test:** Check reload count, current/backup config, and error state after reloads
- **Test:** Simulate edge cases (file deletion, permission errors)

### 2.4 Edge Cases
- **Test:** Rapid file changes (debounce logic)
- **Test:** Simultaneous edits from multiple sources
- **Test:** Large config files

### 2.5 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All major hot reload scenarios are covered
- [ ] Error handling and rollback are verified
- [ ] Status reporting is correct in all cases

## 3. CLI/UX & Documentation Validation

### 3.1 CLI/UX Tests
- **Test:** Enable/disable hot reload from CLI
- **Test:** Show current hot reload status
- **Test:** Manually trigger reload or rollback
- **Test:** CLI output for reload events and errors is clear

### 3.2 Documentation Tests
- **Test:** Getting started guide covers hot reload usage
- **Test:** Troubleshooting guide addresses common issues
- **Test:** Example workflows are provided and work as described

### 3.3 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Developers can enable and use hot reload with minimal setup
- [ ] Troubleshooting steps are clear and actionable
- [ ] CLI support is intuitive and robust

## 4. Performance & Reliability

### 4.1 Performance Tests
- **Test:** File change to reload latency <1s for typical configs
- **Test:** No memory leaks or resource issues during repeated reloads

### 4.2 Reliability Tests
- **Test:** Hot reload remains stable during extended development sessions
- **Test:** No regressions or breaking changes to existing features

### 4.3 Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<5% overhead)
- [ ] Hot reload is stable and reliable in real-world use

## 5. Success Criteria
- All deliverables in the execution plan are validated by tests
- File system event tests pass reliably in local/dev environments
- Integration/system tests cover all major scenarios and edge cases
- Documentation and CLI/UX are validated by user testing
- Hot reload is ready for production and developer adoption
