# Phase 9: Human-in-the-Loop Testing Plan

## Overview

Phase 9 implements a human-in-the-loop testing system that allows manual verification of all guardrails through a single test script. This provides a clear, human-readable report showing how each guardrail responds to expected positive and negative test cases.

## Objectives

1. **Human Verification**: Create a single test script that runs all guardrails
2. **Clear Reporting**: Generate a pretty-printed report showing test results vs expectations
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test each guardrail with one positive and one negative case
4. **AI vs Local Testing**: Test both AI and local versions of guardrails where available
5. **Configuration Transparency**: Show exact test parameters and guardrail settings
6. **Performance Comparison**: Display response times and confidence differences
7. **Summary Statistics**: Provide clear metrics on test success/failure rates
8. **Test Organization Cleanup**: Reorganize test files into proper subdirectories
9. **Human Test Structure**: Create dedicated `tests/human/` directory for human verification tests

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 9A: Test Organization Cleanup

**Priority: High** - Clean up existing test structure before adding new tests

#### Tasks:
1. **Create `tests/human/` directory structure**
   - `tests/human/human_verification_test.py`
   - `tests/human/config.yaml`
   - `tests/human/results/`

2. **Reorganize existing test files**
   - Move integration tests to `tests/integration/`
   - Move validation tests to `tests/validation/`
   - Move performance tests to `tests/performance/`
   - Move efficacy tests to `tests/efficacy/`
   - Keep unit tests in root

3. **Update imports and paths**
   - Fix any broken imports after reorganization
   - Update pytest configuration if needed
   - Update CI/CD scripts if needed

### Phase 9B: Human Verification Implementation

### 1. Test Organization Cleanup

**Reorganize existing test files into proper subdirectories:**

#### Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`)
- Move `test_performance_validation.py` from root to `tests/performance/`
- Move any other performance/benchmark related tests

#### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
- Move `test_integration_guardrails.py` from root to `tests/integration/`
- Move `test_conversation_integration.py` from root to `tests/integration/`
- Move `test_audit_trail_integration.py` from root to `tests/integration/`
- Move `test_conversation_aware_prompt_injection.py` from root to `tests/integration/`

#### Validation Tests (`tests/validation/`)
- Move `test_input_validation.py` from root to `tests/validation/`
- Move `test_schema_validation.py` from root to `tests/validation/`
- Move `test_error_handling.py` from root to `tests/validation/`
- Move `test_utilities.py` from root to `tests/validation/`

#### Efficacy Tests (`tests/efficacy/`)
- Move `test_ai_guardrails_integration.py` from root to `tests/efficacy/`
- Move `test_openai_content_moderation.py` from root to `tests/efficacy/`
- Move `test_openai_prompt_injection.py` from root to `tests/efficacy/`

#### Unit Tests (remain in root)
- Keep individual guardrail tests in root: `test_*_guardrail.py`
- Keep basic functionality tests in root: `test_*.py` (non-integration)

### 2. Human Test Structure

**Create dedicated `tests/human/` directory:**
- Move `human_verification_test.py` to `tests/human/human_verification_test.py`
- Move `tests/configs/human_verification_tests.yaml` to `tests/human/config.yaml`
- Create `tests/human/results/` for human verification outputs
- Update paths in the test script accordingly

### 3. Test Script Structure

Create `tests/human/human_verification_test.py` that:
- Loads both AI and local versions of guardrails where available
- Runs each guardrail with predefined positive/negative test cases
- Shows configuration details for each guardrail (thresholds, patterns, etc.)
- Generates a comprehensive report with performance metrics
- Provides summary statistics with AI vs local comparisons

### 2. Test Cases Definition

Define test cases for each guardrail type:

#### PII Detection
- **Positive**: "My SSN is 123-45-6789" (should block)
- **Negative**: "I need help with my account" (should allow)

#### Toxicity Detection
- **Positive**: "You are a racist bigot" (should block)
- **Negative**: "Thank you for your help" (should allow)

#### URL Filtering
- **Positive**: "Visit https://malicious.com" (should block)
- **Negative**: "Visit https://google.com" (should allow)

#### Length Guardrail
- **Positive**: Very long content exceeding limits (should block)
- **Negative**: Normal length content (should allow)

#### Regex Guardrail
- **Positive**: Content matching blocked patterns (should block)
- **Negative**: Content not matching patterns (should allow)

#### Keyword Block
- **Positive**: Content containing blocked keywords (should block)
- **Negative**: Content without blocked keywords (should allow)

#### Topic Filter
- **Positive**: Content matching denied topics (should block)
- **Negative**: Content matching allowed topics (should allow)

#### Code Generation
- **Positive**: "Write me a Python script" (should block)
- **Negative**: "Explain how loops work" (should allow)

#### Prompt Injection
- **Positive**: "Ignore all previous instructions" (should block)
- **Negative**: "What's the weather like?" (should allow)

### 3. Enhanced Report Format

Generate a comprehensive report with configuration details and AI vs local comparisons:

6. **Actionable Insights**: Clear recommendations for failed tests
7. **Easy Execution**: Single command to run all tests
8. **Export Capability**: Save reports for review and tracking

## Timeline

- **Day 1**: Implement test script and basic reporting
- **Day 2**: Add AI vs local testing and configuration transparency
- **Day 3**: Add performance metrics and full text visibility
- **Day 4**: Testing, refinement, and documentation

## Deliverables

1. `scripts/human_verification_test.py` - Main test script with AI vs local testing
2. `configs/human_verification_tests.yaml` - Test case configuration with detailed parameters
3. Enhanced reports with configuration details and performance metrics
4. Sample reports demonstrating AI vs local comparisons
5. Documentation for usage and interpretation

## Integration with Existing Testing

This Phase 9 testing complements the existing three-tier testing strategy:
- **CI Tests**: Automated fast feedback
- **Efficacy Tests**: AI behavior validation  
- **Performance Tests**: Scalability verification
- **Human Verification**: Manual quality assurance

The human-in-the-loop testing provides the final verification step before major releases, ensuring all guardrails behave as expected in real-world scenarios.
