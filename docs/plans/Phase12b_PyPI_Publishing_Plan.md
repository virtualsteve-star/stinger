# Phase 12b: PyPI Publishing Setup and Execution

**Status**: GitHub Release created ✅, PyPI publishing failed ❌ (missing API token)

## 🎯 Objective
Complete the PyPI publishing of stinger-guardrails-alpha v0.1.0a3

## 📋 Task Breakdown

### What YOU (Steve) Must Do

#### 1. Create PyPI API Token (5 minutes)
**You must do this - I cannot access your PyPI account**

1. Go to https://pypi.org (log in or create account if needed)
2. Navigate to Account Settings → API tokens
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Configure token:
   - Token name: `stinger-github-actions` (or similar)
   - Scope: "Entire account" (or project-specific if stinger-guardrails-alpha already exists)
5. Click "Create token"
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (starts with `pypi-`)
   - You only see it once!
   - Save it temporarily in a secure location

#### 2. Add Token to GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)
**You must do this - I cannot access repository settings**

1. Go to https://github.com/virtualsteve-star/stinger/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN` (must be exactly this)
   - Value: Paste your PyPI token
4. Click "Add secret"

#### 3. Give Me the Go-Ahead
Once steps 1 & 2 are complete, tell me "Token added, proceed with publishing"

### What I (Claude) Will Do

#### 1. Re-run Failed Workflow
```bash
gh run rerun 16131869307
```

#### 2. Monitor Publishing
- Check workflow status
- Verify successful completion
- Confirm package is live on PyPI

#### 3. Test Installation
```bash
pip install stinger-guardrails-alpha==0.1.0a3
```

#### 4. Update Documentation (if needed)
- Add PyPI badge to README
- Update installation instructions
- Create announcement

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Token Still Fails
1. Verify token was copied correctly (no extra spaces)
2. Check token scope (needs upload permissions)
3. Ensure secret name is exactly `PYPI_API_TOKEN`

### If Package Name Conflict
- PyPI might say package already exists
- We'd need to check ownership or use different name

## 📅 Timeline
- Your part: ~10 minutes (create token + add to GitHub)
- My part: ~5 minutes (re-run and verify)
- Total: ~15 minutes

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Workflow completes successfully
- Package appears on https://pypi.org/project/stinger-guardrails-alpha/
- `pip install stinger-guardrails-alpha` works

## 🔄 Handoff Points

1. **You → Me**: After adding token, say "Token added, proceed with publishing"
2. **Me → You**: I'll confirm when package is live and provide the PyPI URL
3. **You → Me**: (Optional) If you want me to create announcement or update docs

## 📝 Notes
- The GitHub Release (v0.1.0a3) is already created ✅
- The workflow is configured correctly ✅
- Only missing piece is the PyPI API token ❌

## 🎉 Once Complete
- Package will be publicly available on PyPI
- Users can `pip install stinger-guardrails-alpha`
- We can proceed with announcements and promotion
