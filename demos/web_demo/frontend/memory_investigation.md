=== Frontend Memory Investigation ===

## Environment
- Node.js: v23.10.0
- npm: 10.9.2
- react-scripts: 5.0.1

## Current .env Settings
```
# Memory optimization for React development server
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
FAST_REFRESH=false
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096

# Skip preflight check to avoid version conflicts
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true

# Reduce Webpack memory usage
IMAGE_INLINE_SIZE_LIMIT=0
DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true

# API endpoint
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://localhost:8000
```

## Investigation Findings

### 1. Production Build Works Fine
- `npm run build` completes successfully
- Bundle size: ~65KB gzipped (well under 2MB limit)
- Production server can serve the built files

### 2. Memory Optimizations Already Applied
- NODE_OPTIONS set to 4GB max heap size
- Source maps disabled
- Fast refresh disabled
- ESLint plugin disabled
- Image inlining disabled

### 3. Potential Issues with Dev Server
- Using react-scripts 5.0.1 with Node.js v23.10.0 (very new version)
- CRA webpack dev server known to have memory issues

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Production Build (Immediate Fix)
Since production build works fine, we can:
1. Run `npm run build` 
2. Use `npm run start:frontend:prod` (via serve-production.js)
3. This bypasses the memory-hungry dev server entirely

### Option 2: Migrate to Vite (Better Long-term)
- Vite has much better memory performance
- Faster HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Better compatibility with modern Node versions

### Option 3: Downgrade Node.js (Quick Fix)
- Node v23 is bleeding edge, try Node 18 or 20 LTS
- CRA may have compatibility issues with v23

## Next Steps
1. Test Option 1 first (production build approach)
2. If dev experience needed, consider Vite migration
3. Continue with backend enhancements while using production build
