"""
Efficacy Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive efficacy tests for AI guardrails.
These tests measure accuracy, false positive rates, and performance.

These tests are marked with @pytest.mark.efficacy and @pytest.mark.slow
and should be run selectively in CI, not during regular development.
