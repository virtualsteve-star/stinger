# Phase 6c Publishing Plan

**Status: ðŸ”´ NOT STARTED**  
**Start Date**: 2025-06-27  
**Completion Date**: TBD  

## Overview

## Status: ðŸ”´ NOT STARTED

**Start Date**: TBD (After Phase 6b completion)  
**Current Status**: Not started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 6b (Compliance Logging) ðŸ”´ PENDING

## Objectives
- Prepare and publish the Stinger LLM Guardrails Framework to PyPI and TestPyPI
- Ensure package quality and compatibility
- Create proper release documentation and changelog
- Establish release process for future versions

## Key Deliverables
- **Package preparation**: Finalize version, metadata, and dependencies
- **PyPI and TestPyPI publishing**: Successful package publication
- **Release documentation**: Comprehensive release notes and changelog
- **GitHub release**: Tagged release with proper documentation
- **Installation verification**: Confirm package works from PyPI install

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Package Preparation
**Status**: ðŸ”´ PENDING
**Implementation**:
- Finalize version number (likely 1.0.0 for first release)
- Update `pyproject.toml` with final metadata
- Ensure all dependencies are properly specified
- Validate package structure and imports
- Update `README.md` with installation instructions
- Create comprehensive `CHANGELOG.md`

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Review and finalize version number
- [ ] Update package metadata in `pyproject.toml`
- [ ] Verify all dependencies are correctly specified
- [ ] Test package build locally
- [ ] Update README with PyPI installation instructions
- [ ] Create detailed changelog from commit history

### 2. Package Validation
**Status**: ðŸ”´ PENDING
**Implementation**:
- Build package and validate with twine
- Test installation in clean virtual environments
- Verify all CLI commands work from PyPI install
- Test all demos and examples
- Validate documentation accessibility

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Build package: `python -m build`
- [ ] Validate with twine: `twine check dist/*`
- [ ] Test installation: `pip install stinger-llm-guardrails`
- [ ] Verify CLI: `stinger --help`
- [ ] Test all demos from PyPI install
- [ ] Verify documentation is accessible

### 3. TestPyPI Publishing
**Status**: ðŸ”´ PENDING
**Implementation**:
- Publish to TestPyPI first for validation
- Test complete installation and functionality
- Verify all features work as expected
- Test in different environments (Python versions, OS)

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Configure TestPyPI credentials
- [ ] Upload to TestPyPI: `twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`
- [ ] Test installation from TestPyPI
- [ ] Verify all functionality works
- [ ] Test in multiple environments
- [ ] Document any issues found

### 4. PyPI Publishing
**Status**: ðŸ”´ PENDING
**Implementation**:
- Publish to official PyPI after TestPyPI validation
- Create GitHub release with proper documentation
- Tag release in Git repository
- Announce release to community

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Configure PyPI credentials
- [ ] Upload to PyPI: `twine upload dist/*`
- [ ] Create Git tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
- [ ] Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.0`
- [ ] Create GitHub release with release notes
- [ ] Update documentation links

### 5. Post-Release Verification
**Status**: ðŸ”´ PENDING
**Implementation**:
- Monitor installation success rates
- Verify documentation accessibility
- Test in various environments
- Collect feedback and address issues

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Monitor PyPI download statistics
- [ ] Test installation in different environments
- [ ] Verify documentation links work
- [ ] Monitor for installation issues
- [ ] Address any post-release issues

## Test Plan

### Package Build and Validation
- [ ] Package builds successfully with `python -m build`
- [ ] Twine validation passes: `twine check dist/*`
- [ ] All imports work correctly in built package
- [ ] No missing dependencies or broken imports

### Installation Testing
- [ ] Install from TestPyPI in clean environment
- [ ] Install from PyPI in clean environment
- [ ] All CLI commands work: `stinger --help`, `stinger health`, etc.
- [ ] All demos run successfully from PyPI install
- [ ] Documentation is accessible and complete

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] All filters work correctly from PyPI install
- [ ] Configuration loading works from PyPI install
- [ ] Conversation API works from PyPI install
- [ ] Rate limiting works from PyPI install
- [ ] Health monitoring works from PyPI install

### Environment Testing
- [ ] Python 3.8+ compatibility
- [ ] macOS, Linux, Windows compatibility
- [ ] Different Python environments (venv, conda, etc.)
- [ ] Different installation methods (pip, pipx, etc.)

## Exit Criteria
- [ ] Package successfully published to PyPI
- [ ] Package successfully published to TestPyPI
- [ ] Installation works in clean environments
- [ ] All functionality verified from PyPI install
- [ ] GitHub release created with proper documentation
- [ ] Documentation updated with PyPI installation instructions
- [ ] Release notes and changelog complete

## Timeline/Sequence
1. **Day 1-2**: Package preparation and validation
2. **Day 3**: TestPyPI publishing and testing
3. **Day 4**: PyPI publishing and GitHub release
4. **Day 5**: Post-release verification and monitoring

## Dependencies & Risks
- **PyPI account setup**: Need proper account and credentials
- **Package metadata**: Must be accurate and complete
- **Dependency conflicts**: Ensure no conflicts with existing packages
- **Documentation quality**: Critical for user adoption
- **Release process**: Must be repeatable for future versions

## Architecture Considerations

### Package Structure
- Maintain current package structure
- Ensure all imports work correctly
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-specified
- Include all necessary data files and configurations

### Release Process
- Establish repeatable release process
- Use semantic versioning
- Maintain changelog for all releases
- Tag releases in Git repository

### Documentation
- Update README with PyPI installation
- Ensure all documentation links work
- Include quick start examples
- Provide troubleshooting guide

## Success Metrics
- Successful PyPI publication
- Successful TestPyPI publication
- Installation works in clean environments
- All functionality verified from PyPI install
- Documentation is accessible and complete
- Release process is documented and repeatable
