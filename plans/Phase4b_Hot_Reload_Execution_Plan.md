# Phase 4b Hot Reload Execution Plan

**Status: âœ… COMPLETED**  
**Start Date**: 2025-06-24  
**Completion Date**: 2025-06-24  

## Overview
Phase 4b is dedicated to fully completing, testing, and productionizing the Hot Reload feature for the LLM Guardrails Framework. While the core logic was implemented in Phase 4, robust file system event handling, automated integration tests, and developer-facing documentation remain outstanding. This phase will ensure hot reload is reliable, well-documented, and easy to use in real-world development workflows.

## Objectives
- Achieve robust, automated file system event handling for configuration hot reload
- Provide comprehensive integration and system test coverage for hot reload scenarios
- Deliver clear documentation and CLI support for hot reload usage and troubleshooting
- Ensure hot reload is production-ready and developer-friendly

## Key Deliverables

### 1. Automated File System Event Testing (High Priority)
**Goal:** Ensure that file changes on disk reliably trigger configuration reloads, validation, and rollback as needed.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Design and implement integration/system tests that:
    - [ ] Modify config files on disk
    - [ ] Wait for and verify that the reload callback is triggered by watchdog
    - [ ] Validate that new configs are loaded and applied, or rolled back on error
    - [ ] Use threading primitives (e.g., `threading.Event`) to synchronize test and observer
    - [ ] Add debug output to confirm event flow
- [ ] Mark these as integration/system tests (may be skipped in CI if flaky)
- [ ] Document known limitations and workarounds for CI environments

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tests reliably pass on local/dev environments
- [ ] File changes trigger reloads within 1 second
- [ ] Rollback occurs on invalid config
- [ ] Status reporting is accurate after reloads

### 2. Integration Test Coverage (High Priority)
**Goal:** Validate hot reload in real development workflows and error scenarios.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement integration tests for:
    - [ ] Development workflow: Edit config file, verify reload without restart
    - [ ] Error handling: Introduce invalid config, verify validation and rollback
    - [ ] Status reporting: Check reload count, current/backup config, etc.
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases (rapid changes, file deletion, permission errors)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All major hot reload scenarios are covered by integration tests
- [ ] Error handling and rollback are verified
- [ ] Status reporting is correct in all cases

### 3. Documentation & Developer Guidance (Medium Priority)
**Goal:** Make hot reload easy to use and troubleshoot for all developers.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add a section to the getting started guide and troubleshooting guide:
    - [ ] How to enable and use hot reload in development
    - [ ] How to interpret status and debug output
    - [ ] Known limitations and troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Provide example configs and usage patterns
- [ ] Document CLI options for hot reload

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Developers can enable and use hot reload with minimal setup
- [ ] Troubleshooting steps are clear and actionable
- [ ] Example workflows are provided

### 4. CLI/UX Polish (Optional, Stretch)
**Goal:** Make hot reload accessible and user-friendly via the CLI.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add CLI options/commands to:
    - [ ] Enable/disable hot reload
    - [ ] Show current hot reload status
    - [ ] Manually trigger reload or rollback
- [ ] Improve CLI output for reload events and errors

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Hot reload can be controlled from the CLI
- [ ] Status and errors are clearly reported to the user

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Automated Event & Integration Testing
- [ ] File system event tests implemented
- [ ] Integration tests for workflow, error, and status

### Week 2: Documentation & CLI Polish
- [ ] Documentation and troubleshooting guide updated
- [ ] CLI options and UX improvements (if prioritized)

### Week 3: Validation & Hardening
- [ ] Full test suite execution (manual and automated)
- [ ] Performance and reliability validation
- [ ] Final polish and code review

## Success Criteria
- **File system event tests pass reliably in dev/local environments**
- **All major hot reload scenarios are covered by integration tests**
- **Documentation enables any developer to use and troubleshoot hot reload**
- **CLI support (if implemented) is intuitive and robust**
- **No regressions or breaking changes to existing features**

## Risks & Mitigation
- **File event tests may be flaky in CI:**
    - Mark as integration/system tests, run in local/staging
    - Provide manual validation steps
- **Threading/event loop issues:**
    - Use synchronization primitives, add debug output
- **Developer confusion:**
    - Provide clear docs, troubleshooting, and CLI feedback

## Exit Criteria
- All deliverables above are complete and validated
- Hot reload is reliable, documented, and easy to use
- All tests (unit, integration, system) pass in local/dev environments
- Ready for production and developer adoption
