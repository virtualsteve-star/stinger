2. **Topic Extraction Accuracy**: AI-based topic extraction needed tuning for optimal results
3. **Role-Based Access**: Flexible role system required careful design for extensibility
4. **Health Monitoring**: Centralized monitoring needed to balance detail with performance

### Process Improvements
1. **Documentation First**: Writing documentation early helped clarify requirements
2. **Incremental Testing**: Continuous testing throughout development caught issues early
3. **User Feedback**: Early user testing of documentation improved usability
4. **Modular Design**: Keeping features modular enabled easier testing and integration

## Risks Mitigated

### Technical Risks
