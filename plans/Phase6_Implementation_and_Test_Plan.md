## Completion Summary

Phase 6 has been successfully completed with all core objectives achieved:

1. **Enhanced Rate Limiting**: Global rate limiting with role-based overrides implemented and tested
2. **Topic Control**: Complete topic allow/deny functionality with regex support
3. **Role-Based Overrides**: Configurable role limits and exempt roles
4. **Health Monitoring**: CLI-based health dashboard with comprehensive status reporting
5. **Documentation**: Getting Started guide and Extensibility Guide completed

The only remaining work is publishing to PyPI, which has been moved to Phase 6a to allow for a dedicated focus on the publishing workflow and quality assurance.

**Next Phase**: Phase 6a - Publishing to PyPI and TestPyPI
