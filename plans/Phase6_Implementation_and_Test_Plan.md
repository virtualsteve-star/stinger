# Phase 6 Implementation and Test Plan â€“ LLM Guardrails Framework

## Objectives
- Add policy and context controls to the Stinger framework
- Enable dynamic configuration and health monitoring
- Prepare and publish the package to PyPI and TestPyPI
- **Deliver great "getting started" documentation and an extensibility guide for new users and developers**

## Key Deliverables
- Rate limiting per API key/user
- Topic allow/deny lists
- Role-based overrides
- Configuration hot reload (without restart)
- Health monitoring dashboard
- PyPI and TestPyPI publishing
- **Comprehensive "Getting Started" documentation for new users**
- **Extensibility Guide: How to create additional filters/guardrails**

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Rate Limiting per API Key/User
- Design a rate limiting interface (in-memory, Redis, or pluggable backend)
- Integrate rate limiting checks into the GuardrailPipeline
- Add configuration options for rate limits (per minute/hour, per user/key)
- Log and expose rate limit status/errors

### 2. Topic Allow/Deny Lists
- Add support for topic-based allow/deny lists in configuration
- Implement topic extraction (from prompt/metadata)
- Enforce allow/deny logic in the pipeline
- Provide clear error messages for denied topics

### 3. Role-Based Overrides
- Add role metadata to pipeline input (user, admin, system, etc.)
- Allow configuration of role-based guardrail overrides (e.g., admins bypass some filters)
- Implement override logic in the pipeline
- Document override scenarios and configuration

### 4. Configuration Hot Reload
- Implement file watcher or polling for config changes
- Reload configuration in-memory without service restart
- Validate and rollback on config errors
- Log reload events and errors

### 5. Health Monitoring Dashboard
- Expose health/status endpoint (REST or CLI)
- Track and report status of all guardrails (enabled, available, error state)
- Show recent errors, reloads, and rate limit events
- Optionally, integrate with Prometheus or similar

### 6. PyPI and TestPyPI Publishing
- Finalize version, metadata, and changelog
- Build and validate package (twine check)
- Publish to TestPyPI, verify install and CLI
- Publish to PyPI
- Tag release in GitHub

### 7. Getting Started Documentation
- Write a clear, concise "Getting Started" guide for new users
- Cover installation, basic usage, running demos, and troubleshooting
- Ensure new users can get up and running in <10 minutes

### 8. Extensibility Guide
- Write an "Extensibility Guide" for developers
- Explain the architecture for filters/guardrails
- Provide step-by-step instructions and examples for creating new filters
- Document best practices and extension points

## Test Plan

### Rate Limiting
- Unit tests for rate limiter logic (in-memory, backend)
- Integration tests for exceeding limits, reset, and error handling
- Test config reload of rate limits

### Topic Allow/Deny
- Unit tests for topic extraction and matching
- Integration tests for allowed/denied topics
- Test config reload of topic lists

### Role Overrides
- Unit tests for role-based logic
- Integration tests for override scenarios
- Test config reload of role overrides

### Config Hot Reload
- Unit tests for reload logic and error handling
- Integration tests for live config changes (add/remove/modify guardrails, limits, topics)
- Test rollback on invalid config

### Health Dashboard
- Unit tests for status reporting
- Integration tests for health endpoint/CLI
- Simulate errors and verify reporting

### PyPI Publishing
- Build and validate package (twine, pip install)
- Test CLI and all demos/examples from PyPI/TestPyPI install
- Confirm documentation and metadata

### Documentation
- Review "Getting Started" guide for clarity and completeness
- Test onboarding flow with a new user
- Review Extensibility Guide for accuracy and usefulness
- Test creating a new filter using the guide

## Exit Criteria
- All features implemented and tested as above
- All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Package published to PyPI and TestPyPI
- Documentation and dashboard up to date
- **"Getting Started" guide enables new users to set up and use policy controls in <10 minutes**
- **Extensibility Guide enables developers to create new filters/guardrails**

## Timeline/Sequence
1. Implement and test rate limiting
2. Add topic allow/deny and role overrides
3. Implement config hot reload
4. Build health dashboard
5. Finalize docs (Getting Started, Extensibility Guide) and publish to PyPI/TestPyPI

## Dependencies & Risks
- Rate limiting backend (if using Redis or external)
- File system access for config reload
- PyPI account and credentials
- Backward compatibility with existing configs
- Thorough testing to avoid regressions

This plan ensures Phase 6 delivers robust policy controls, dynamic configuration, a public release, and world-class onboarding and extensibility documentation for Stinger.
