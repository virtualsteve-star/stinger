## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Already Implemented (75% Complete)
- **Enhanced rate limiting**: Global rate limiting with per-API-key/user limits, role-based overrides, memory backend
- **Topic allow/deny lists**: Complete TopicFilter implementation with allow/deny/both modes, regex support
- **Role-based overrides**: Configurable role limits, exempt roles, pipeline integration
- **Health status methods**: `get_config()` methods on all filters
- **Configuration validation**: YAML schema validation with error messages
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation and error recovery mechanisms
- **Comprehensive testing**: 71/71 tests passing (100% success rate)

### ðŸ”´ Remaining Work (25% Complete)
- **Health monitoring dashboard**: Basic status methods exist, but no dashboard
- **PyPI publishing**: Not yet implemented
- **Documentation**: Getting Started and Extensibility guides needed

- Thread-safe operations
- Edge case handling (zero/negative limits)

### âœ… 2. Topic Allow/Deny Lists (COMPLETE)
**Status**: âœ… 100% Complete - All tests passing
**Implementation**:

### âœ… 3. Role-Based Overrides (COMPLETE)
**Status**: âœ… 90% Complete - Basic role support working
**Implementation**:
- Role configuration in YAML
- Rate limit overrides per role
- Exempt roles (admin/system bypass)
- Pipeline integration

### ðŸ”´ 4. Health Monitoring Dashboard (IN PROGRESS)
**Current State**: Basic `get_config()` methods exist
**Enhancements Needed**:
- CLI health status command (`stinger health`)
- Comprehensive status reporting for all guardrails
- Recent errors and events tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check endpoints for monitoring

**Implementation**:
```python
class HealthMonitor:
    """Health monitoring and status reporting."""
    
    def get_system_health(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get comprehensive system health status."""
        pass
    
    def get_filter_status(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get status of all filters."""
        pass
    
    def get_recent_errors(self, limit: int = 10) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get recent errors and events."""
        pass
```

### ðŸ”´ 5. Getting Started Documentation (PENDING)
**Implementation**:
- Write comprehensive "Getting Started" guide
- Cover installation, basic usage, running demos
- Include troubleshooting section
- Ensure new users can get up and running in <10 minutes
- Add quick start examples and templates

### ðŸ”´ 6. Extensibility Guide (PENDING)
**Implementation**:
- Write "Extensibility Guide" for developers
- Explain filter/guardrail architecture
- Provide step-by-step instructions for creating new filters
- Document best practices and extension points
- Include example implementations

### ðŸ”´ 7. PyPI and TestPyPI Publishing (PENDING - MOVED TO END)
**Implementation**:
- Finalize version, metadata, and changelog
- Build and validate package (twine check)
- Publish to TestPyPI, verify install and CLI
- Publish to PyPI
- Tag release in GitHub
- Create GitHub release with release notes

## Test Plan

### âœ… Enhanced Rate Limiting (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Unit tests for global rate limiter logic
- âœ… Integration tests for API key/user rate limiting
- âœ… Test rate limit configuration and reload
- âœ… Performance tests for rate limiting overhead

### âœ… Topic Allow/Deny (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Unit tests for topic extraction and matching
- âœ… Integration tests for allowed/denied topics
- âœ… Test topic extraction accuracy
- âœ… Test configuration reload of topic lists

### âœ… Role Overrides (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Unit tests for role-based logic
- âœ… Integration tests for override scenarios
- âœ… Test role configuration and validation
- âœ… Test override behavior in pipeline

### ðŸ”´ Health Dashboard (PENDING)
- Unit tests for health monitoring
- Integration tests for CLI health commands
- Test error tracking and reporting
- Test performance metrics collection

### ðŸ”´ PyPI Publishing (PENDING)
- Build and validate package (twine, pip install)
- Test CLI and all demos from PyPI/TestPyPI install
- Verify documentation and metadata
- Test installation in clean environments

### ðŸ”´ Documentation (PENDING)

- Test onboarding flow with new users
- Review Extensibility Guide for accuracy
- Test creating new filters using the guide

## Exit Criteria
- All features implemented and tested as above
- All tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Package published to PyPI and TestPyPI
- Documentation and dashboard up to date
- **"Getting Started" guide enables new users to set up and use policy controls in <10 minutes**
- **Extensibility Guide enables developers to create new filters/guardrails**

## Timeline/Sequence (Updated)
1. **Week 1-2**: âœ… Enhanced rate limiting (COMPLETE)
2. **Week 3-4**: âœ… Topic allow/deny lists and role overrides (COMPLETE)
3. **Week 5-6**: ðŸ”´ Health monitoring dashboard (IN PROGRESS)
4. **Week 7-8**: ðŸ”´ Documentation (Getting Started, Extensibility Guide)
5. **Week 9**: ðŸ”´ PyPI publishing and release (MOVED TO END)

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Rate limiting backend**: May need Redis or external service for production
- **Topic extraction accuracy**: AI-based extraction may require tuning
- **PyPI account and credentials**: Need proper account setup
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure existing configs continue to work
- **Documentation quality**: Critical for user adoption

## Architecture Considerations

### âœ… Rate Limiting Architecture (COMPLETE)
- Built on existing conversation rate limiting
- Added global rate limiting layer
- Support for memory backend (Redis/database future)
- Integrated with existing pipeline architecture

### âœ… Topic Control Architecture (COMPLETE)
- Implemented as a new filter type
- Support for multiple extraction methods
- Integrated with existing filter pipeline
- Maintained backward compatibility

### ðŸ”´ Health Monitoring Architecture (IN PROGRESS)
- Build on existing `get_config()` methods
- Add centralized health monitoring
- Support CLI and programmatic access
- Include performance metrics

### ðŸ”´ Documentation Architecture (PENDING)
- Separate user and developer documentation
- Include interactive examples
- Provide templates and starter kits
- Maintain version-specific documentation
