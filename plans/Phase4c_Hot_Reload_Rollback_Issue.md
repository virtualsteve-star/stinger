# Issue: Rollback of Hot Reload Functionality (Phase 4c) â€” Rationale and Tracking

## Summary
Hot reload was removed from the Stinger codebase as part of Phase 4c due to significant architectural, testing, and maintenance issues. This issue documents the rationale for the rollback and serves as a permanent record for future reference.

## Reason for Rollback
- **Excessive Complexity:** Hot reload introduced file system watching, threading, and observer lifecycle management, which added unnecessary complexity to the codebase.
- **Unreliable File System Events:** File watching was inconsistent across platforms, leading to unpredictable behavior and test failures.
- **Flaky Integration Tests:** Tests relying on file system events were unreliable, causing CI failures and making it difficult to maintain a stable test suite.
- **Maintenance Overhead:** The feature required ongoing fixes and workarounds, distracting from core development and increasing the maintenance burden.
- **Scope Creep:** Hot reload grew beyond its intended purpose as an experimental feature and became a major source of technical debt.
- **Limited Value:** The core content filtering functionality works perfectly without hot reload, and most users do not require live config reloading.

## Benefits of Rollback
- **Restores focus on core filtering functionality**
- **Improves reliability and test stability**
- **Simplifies the codebase and reduces dependencies**
- **Eases future maintenance and development**

## Status
- [x] Hot reload code and tests removed
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] All core functionality and tests passing

*This issue documents the architectural and testing problems caused by hot reload, and the benefits realized by its removal. Future consideration of hot reload should be approached as a separate, isolated experimental module.*
